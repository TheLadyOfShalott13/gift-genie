# Personal Relationship Management (PRM) System

## Project Specifications
This project is used to demonstrate an example of **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) CRUD application** with file management using the **Multer** library. The ODM used here is **mongoose**. The backend is hosted as a **microservice**, each CRUD action invokes an **API** to a service. Login authentication is done using **JWT**.

## Basic Idea
This idea first came to me in my last full time job where I was usually tasked with gift selection for co-workers' birthdays. Usually, a week before a coworker's birthday, a whatsapp group would be created where we would start our discussions for gifts, cake and even a birthday prank setup. I started to wonder if there was a way to suggest gifts and make the whole gift selection process easier instead of laboriously poring through different options online. Perhaps, if accompanied by a reminder system, we can even send alerts for upcoming birthdays, pending gift purchases and other important dates.  

For the structure of a coworker's profile, which would contain information crucial to the gift selection/suggestion process (including their personal information, important dates, interests and gifts) was made clearer to me from my time playing an awesome indie game called ["Stardew Valley"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley). I drew inspiration from the meticulously created NPC profiles which categorized gifts as _Loved_, _Liked_, _Neutral_, _Disliked_ and _Hated_ - each gift from these categories would have a direct effect on the friendship level between the player and the NPC in question. 

In short, this is a solution that enters a person's details including their birthday, interests and gifts - to be categorized as loved, liked, neutral and disliked. There is a calendar view that shows upcoming birthdays and this can be used to plan for birthdays in advance. Gifts can be suggested based on a person's interests. A gift purchase request is then placed with a threshold price entered wherein the cron job shall trigger the purchase of a gift when it falls below the given threshold. 

## Running the Project
### Prerequisites
The following must be installed and setup before proceeding with running this project:
- MongoDB Server
- MongoDB Compass (GUI for viewing/managing MongoDB data)
- Node Package Manager on the backend server
- Nodemon via command line `npm install nodemon`

_Note: This project uses the Javascript ES6 standard._

### Setting up the backend
In order to run this project, we need to follow the below steps:
1. Navigate to `/server` folder
2. Create a `.env` file just like the following example:
    ```
   MONGO = <MONGO_DB_URL>
   JWT = <JWT>
   FRONTEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
   PORT = 7700
   ```
    - `MONGO_DB_URL` is the MongoDB server URL
    - `JWT` is the Javascript Web Token used for authentication and can be any kind of string generated. 
    - `FRONTEND_URL` refers to the frontend URL which will be included in the exceptions for the CORS policy.
    - `PORT` refers to the backend port number.
3. (Only if running it for the first time) Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies given in the `package.json` file.
4. Run the command `nodemon ./index.js`

### Setting up the frontend
In order to run this project, we need to follow the below steps:
1. Navigate to `/client` folder
2. Create a `.env` file just like the following example:
    ```
    REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:7700'
   ```
    - `REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL` should include the value of your frontend base URL 
    - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` should include the value of your backend base URL 
3. (Only if running it for the first time) Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies given in the `package.json` file.
4. Run the command `npm start`

## Product Features
These are the key functionalities of our application that make it unique and useful:

- Microservice based architecture using RESTful APIs
- User Authentication using JWT based Authorization
- Dynamic data rendering and updates upon user interaction
- Automation of condition-based gift purchases using cron jobs
- File uploading and management


## Use Cases
- Login and Register users using username, email and password in order to implement data isolation and privacy across users.
- Adding and modifying gifts in the database. A price threshold is entered alongside the gift to indicate the max budget for that particular gift. File uploading and management is possible per entry. 
- Adding and modifying interests in the database. A list of gifts may be selected and assigned to a particular interest. File uploading and management is possible per entry.
- Adding and modifying persons in the database. 
  - Enter personal details like name, address, contact information, birthday and upload a picture
  - Assign Interests to this person
  - Assign Gifts to this person based on assigned Interests. Categorize them as either Loved, Liked, Neutral or Disliked.
- Placing a gift purchase, adding a tracking link which can be used to web scrape details and display on our system for delivery updates.
